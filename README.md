Docker files for SaltStack

Note: It is strongly recommended that the default storage engine for Docker not
be set to use the loopback/devicemapper. This will result in very slow builds
and poor performance. Choose `overlay` or `overlay2` if possible.

TL;DR (Lazy version)
====================

For the impatient, images are available
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cachedout/barnacle/).

To pull images: `docker pull cachedout/barnacle`

To use them, replace the name of the containers in the examples below with the
path to the image tag. For example, replace instances of `salt-arch` with
`cachedout/barnacle:arch`.


Installation
============

The following steps will walk you through building and running a Docker image
for Arch Linux.

To build and test another OS, simply change the OS identifier where appropriate.

If you are running Docker for Mac, the `sudo`s below are not necessary.

NOTE: This guide assumes that one's local salt development directory is in
`~/devel/salt`. If this is not the case, adjust the paths below accordingly.

To build an image, change to an image directory and type: `sudo docker build -t
salt-arch .`.

This will download a base image and apply the necessary layers to ensure it has
all the layer necessary to develop Salt with, including all of the development
deps.

After the container is built, you can shell into it and have a look around:

`sudo /usr/bin/docker run --rm -itv ~/devel/salt/:/testing salt-arch /bin/bash`

Your local Salt development directory will be mounted into /testing. Any change
you make locally will be immediatley reflected there and vice-versa.

You can of course run the tests if you like: `python2
/testing/tests/runtests.py`

Running the tests and then exiting
==================================

There is no need to create a shell just to run a test. You can do this with one
command:

`sudo /usr/bin/docker run --rm -itv ~/devel/salt:/testing salt-arch python2 /testing/tests/runtests.py`

Again, this will operate on your local checkout of the Salt repo so you can
quickly make changes and then immediatley see how they will work on any given
platform.

Using .zsh aliases
==================

This repo includes a `docker_salt.zsh` file. It makes running things even
easier. Importing it into your shell is an exercise for the reader. ;] It
understands if you are running Docker for Mac and does not `sudo` for the docker
commands.

To run a single test:

`cts arch integration.modules.beacons` <-- Runs the beacons tests in an Arch container

`cshell arch` <-- Gives you a shell in an Arch container

`cexec arch` <-- Gives you a shell in an already running Arch container (use after cshell)

`csalt-call ubuntu14 state.sls test` <-- Run any salt-call command. caslt <os> <cmd> <args>
